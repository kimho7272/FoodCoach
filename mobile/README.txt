FOODCOACH: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY & ROADMAP

CORE TECH STACK & INFRASTRUCTURE

Frontend: Flutter or React Native for iOS/Android cross-platform efficiency.

Backend (Supabase): PostgreSQL for data, Auth for social logins, and Storage for photos.

AI Vision: Using Google's visual intelligence to identify food and portion sizes.

DETAILED FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION

AI Meal Logging: Auto-categorizes breakfast/lunch/dinner based on timestamps.

Nutrition Analysis: Visualizes the ratio of Carbs, Proteins, and Fats from photos.

Activity Exchange: Translates calories into exercise (e.g., "1 hour of running").

AI Coach 'Apple-y': Provides personalized trends and motivational coaching.

UI/UX STRATEGY: "VIBRANT GLASSMORPHISM"

Visuals: Glassmorphism effects with soft, pastel aurora backgrounds.

Gamification: The 3D character 'Apple-y' handles onboarding and daily interaction.

Navigation: Uses intuitive wheels and swipes instead of heavy text input.

SECURITY & ZERO-FRICTION AUTH

Passkeys: Standardizing on FaceID and Fingerprint biometric authentication.

Data Protection: Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) keeps user data private.

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

Phase 1 (MVP): Supabase Auth integration and core AI photo recognition logic.

Phase 2 (UX): Full vibrant theme implementation and 'Apple-y' animations.

Phase 3 (Optimization): Sync with Apple Health/Google Fit and advanced coaching.
